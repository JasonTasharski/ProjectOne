## Doing:

* Test scraping potential source-sites until one that works well is found
* Make a database of minimal <i>report</i> (each <i>report</i> is one article from the source-site) data from that source-site; start with a manageable number of <i>reports</i> (say, 4)
* Make index.html with templates to view <i>report</i> data


## To Do:

### Minimum:

* Make <i>events</i> to contain <i>reports</i>; hard-code an <i>event</i> containing all <i>reports</i>; hard-code two <i>events</i>, containing all <i>reports</i> between them
* Make index.html show <i>reports</i> within <i>events</i>
* Process <i>reports</i> to get dates and locations from them; use those to create <i>events</i> with those dates and locations (and types? deaths, injuries?)
* Process <i>reports</i> to show the first paragraph of each (plus url/source/date/location), saving and hiding the full text

* Update <i>reports</i> and <i>events</i> over time

* Process <i>reports</i> to show an image alongside the first paragraph
